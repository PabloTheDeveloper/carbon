# One True Editor
Fundamentally, there a finite set of workflows one follows when writing code in some source control that gets deployed and tested.
This is editor agnostic. I should identify those and identify sensible keybindings that best fit these ideas.
For my use case, as my laptop has horrid battery life, I will start with nvim and expand to VSCode and then prompt using editors.

# History Session Logger
I should track everything going on with my laptop.
By everything I mean shell commands, packages installed, config changes,
websites visited, tabs viewed, content copied to clipboard, etc.
This can help me reproduce any issue I'm encountering and encourage a
simplier path to rollback. It can help me write docs on what I'm doing and
observe myself and thinkings.
