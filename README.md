# Carbon.io
Carbon.io contains everything to do with my
computing setup. These configs take some time to
tweak and establish so it is worthwhile to save
them somewhere online. It is also worthwhile to share with others in case it proves helpful.

I had a previous Arch linux setup based on X11
and I did not store it's configs in an
intellegent manner so it was kinda painful to
use that laptop once more. I still need to go
through that one and update it to use these
configs but for now I'm using a clean slate more
or less.

# Where Meaningful Things Are
* `README.md` contains an overview of what this
  is and where things are.
* `.config` contains all my configs.
* `.bashrc` contains my aliases and functions.
* `.readme.md` contains detailed notes of projects and tasks to do.
# What are next steps?
I just want to save time by spending it.
I don't believe in settling on tooling. While
net time savings could be negative the more I
add, my developer satisfaction and
experience add joy and vitality worth an unmeasureable amount.

With that in mind, next steps are entirely about improving workflows I'd be doing. They can't be done without other non-developer experience tasks also being done as then I'll be operating in a vacuum.

See the `readme.md/projects.md/README.md` page.
